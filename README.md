# Students' Knowledge Status


**Abstract:** \
It is the real dataset about the students' knowledge status about the subject of Electrical DC Machines. The dataset had been obtained from Ph.D. Thesis.

**Data Set Information:** \
The users' knowledge class were classified by the authors
using intuitive knowledge classifier (a hybrid ML technique of k-NN and meta-heuristic exploring methods), k-nearest neighbor algorithm.
See article for more details on how the users' data was collected and evaluated by the user modeling server.
